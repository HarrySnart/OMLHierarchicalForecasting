# OML Hierarchical Forecasting
This repo shows how we can perform Hierarchical Forecasting with Oracle Machine Learning and AutoML using OML4Py. The notebook is saved as a native OML Notebook, Jupyter Notebook and HTML. For best compatibility, you can import the OML Native Notebook format directly into OML Notebooks on Autonomous Database. If you are interested in re-producing this, I have included the data as three separate zip files. You will need to unzip and union the data before following the notebook. 

There is a blog post on Medium for this which can be found here: https://medium.com/p/c5e06cf7f099
